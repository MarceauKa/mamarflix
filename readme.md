# Movies2sheet

**Movies2sheet** is a command line tool useful to transform a list of movies into a CSV file.

## Use case

I downloaded (legally üôÉ) several movies and put them into a **Volume** (usually, an external drive).
Now, I want a CSV file containing all of my downloaded movies, plus, additional metadata.

Movies2sheet will:
- Get data from **FFMPEG** such as: duration, size, audio tracks, subtitles, etc
- Get data from [SensCritique.com](https://www.senscritique.com) such as: director, actors, genre, poster, resume, etc

This package is for my own usage (developped in about 2 hours) but I share it with all of you with ‚ô•Ô∏è

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.2
- Composer
- FFMPEG

‚ö†Ô∏è Files in your volume need to be named as following:
```
name 2019.ext
# Ex: Forrest Gump 1994.mkv
name [info] 2019.ext
# Ex: Spirited Away [Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi] 2001.mp4
```

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/MarceauKa/movies2sheet && cd movies2sheet
composer install
cp .env.example .env
```

## Config

Open the `.env` file then edit:

```
VOLUME_PATH=/Volumes/ # Path to the volume
FFMPEG_BIN=/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg # FFMPEG bin path
EXPORT_NAME=movies.csv # Export name located in exports/
```

## Run

```
php index.php app:generate # Generate your export
php index.php app:list # List files in your volume
```

You can get aditional help about command running `php index.php app:generate --help`.

## Example

I have a volume `/Volumes/Toshiba/Movies/` (my external HDD) containing the following files:
- Fight Club 1999.mkv
- Old Boy 2003.mkv
- World War Z 2009.mkv

The command `php index.php app:generate` will output:
```
Name;Year;Duration;Audio;Subs;Format;HDR;Size;Director;...
Fight Club;1999;2h19;EN,FR;FR;Full HD;No;2.64G;David Fincher;...
Old Boy;2003;2h0;FR,KO;FR;HD;No;2.45G;Park Chan-wook;...
World War Z;2009;2h3;FR,EN;FR,EN;4k;Yes;5.65G;Marc Forster;...
```

## Tests

This app contains a lot of tests (Unit, Feature and Integration tests). Just run:

```bash
php index.php app:generate
```

If you see this, **movies2sheet** isn't working.
